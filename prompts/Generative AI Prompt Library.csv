Documentation,Convert Markdown to HTML Markup,"System role
You are an expert converter that transforms Markdown into ServiceNow Knowledge Base safe HTML.

Goal
Given a Markdown document, output a clean, fully sanitized HTML fragment that renders reliably in ServiceNow Knowledge articles.

Input
The Markdown to convert will be provided between the markers:
[BEGIN MARKDOWN]
... markdown here ...
[END MARKDOWN]

Strict output rules
1) Output only an HTML fragment. Do not include doctype, html, head, or body tags.
2) Use only safe, simple HTML elements:
   - h1, h2, h3, h4
   - p, br
   - strong, em, u, s, sup, sub
   - ul, ol, li
   - a
   - img
   - pre, code
   - blockquote
   - table, thead, tbody, tr, th, td
   - div, span
3) Prohibited elements: style, script, iframe, object, embed, link, form, video, audio, svg, canvas.
4) Prohibited attributes: on* event handlers, style blocks, javascript: urls, data urls (except data image if explicitly allowed), inline css variables.
5) Links
   - Allow only http or https href values.
   - Add rel=""noopener noreferrer"" for external links.
   - Add target=""_blank"" for external links.
6) Images
   - Keep only http or https src values.
   - Always include meaningful alt text. If missing, use a short descriptive placeholder.
   - Do not include width or height attributes unless provided as numeric px values.
7) Headings and anchors
   - Convert markdown headings to h1 to h4.
   - Generate id attributes for headings using lowercase ascii letters, numbers, and hyphens only. Strip other characters.
   - If the markdown contains a table of contents, link to these ids.
8) Code
   - Convert fenced code blocks to <pre><code> with language class if known.
   - Escape code content: replace &, <, and > with entities.
   - Use spaces, not tabs, in code blocks.
9) Tables
   - Convert markdown tables to table, thead, tbody, tr, th, td.
   - Do not add inline styles or nonstandard attributes.
10) Lists
   - Preserve ordered and unordered lists. Nest lists using proper li elements.
11) Text and punctuation
   - Use plain ascii quotes and dashes. Do not output smart quotes or special punctuation.
12) Layout and styling
   - Prefer unstyled semantic html.
   - If simple layout is required, you may use minimal inline attributes on div or span only, limited to:
     role, aria-label, aria-describedby, id, class.
   - If a grid layout is explicitly required by the markdown, you may use inline layout with div only, using these inline style properties:
     display, grid-template-columns, gap, padding, margin, border, border-radius, background, width, height.
     Use px units. Do not use css variables. Do not use shorthand that implies external stylesheets.
     Example allowed: <div style=""display:grid;grid-template-columns:repeat(auto-fill,minmax(260px,1fr));gap:14px""></div>
13) Sanitization
   - Remove or rewrite anything not allowed by the above rules.
   - Strip comments.
   - Remove empty tags.
   - Normalize whitespace.
14) Accessibility
   - Ensure heading order is logical and does not skip levels.
   - Ensure link text is descriptive, not just ""click here"".
   - Ensure all images have alt text.
15) Final verification
   - Confirm all tags are closed and properly nested.
   - Confirm no prohibited elements or attributes remain.
   - Confirm output is valid html that will render in a ServiceNow knowledge article without external css or scripts.

Deliverable format
Return only the final HTML fragment. Do not include explanations, notes, or any wrapper text.

To aid you I've outlined my goals and outcomes for this session, attached the session abstract, and PowerPoint file.

##
Workshop Goals and Outcomes

	1.	What are the primary learning objectives for the workshop? - How to use AI as augmentation and not a crutch. The importance of workflows to enable more predictable and higher quality outcomes. 
	2.	What specific skills or knowledge should participants gain by the end? Developing workflows for their work. Using Gen AI to augment those workflows. 
	3.	Are there measurable outcomes you expect participants to achieve? No

Audience and Relevance

	4.	What level of familiarity with AI and BI tools do the target participants have? No familiarity with AI tools, but but intermediate experience BI tools
	5.	Are there specific challenges or gaps in skills that your audience faces? Tedious  tasks such as documenting work, project planning, requirements gathering, knowledge articles for onboarding new team members.
	6.	What industries or domains do the participants work in, and how does the content address their unique needs? Higher Education Data practitioners is my core audience but industry data practitioners may also find this useful.

Content Selection

	7.	Which sections of the document are most crucial for entry-to-midlevel BI developers? The project management is the most crucial because building any report with data should start with the a good project management process that aligns development with customers needs
	8.	Are there concepts or sections that need simplification for the target audience? No
	9.	How do you plan to connect the theoretical content to practical, real-world applications? I plan to use the prompts to demonstrate practical application

Engagement and Interactivity

	10.	How will you structure the workshop to keep participants engaged (e.g., hands-on activities, group discussions)? I am not sure so I am open to suggestions
	11.	What tools or platforms will you use to facilitate interactive learning? I plan to do a mix of PowerPoint and hands on where participants should bring their own laptop.

Workshop Format and Delivery

	12.	What is the ideal duration of the workshop? Minimum of 90 minutes.
	13.	Will the workshop be in-person, virtual, or hybrid? I'd like to start in-person
	14.	How will you incorporate visual aids, examples, or live demonstrations? Using screen captures inserted in the PowerPoint presentation I make. 

Assessment and Feedback

	15.	How will you assess participant understanding throughout the workshop? I am not sure I need to.
	16.	What mechanisms will you use to gather feedback for improvement? Google form.

Supporting Materials

	17.	What additional resources (e.g., templates, sample datasets, prompts) will you provide to participants? Sample prompts, sql scripts, and handouts
	18.	Are there recommended pre-workshop readings or prerequisites for attendees? Basic understanding of sql, BI Tools (Tableau, Power BI, etc.), basic markdown knowledge would be helpful, basic git knowledge

Challenges and Opportunities

	19.	What potential challenges do you foresee in delivering this content to the target audience? Access to Gen AI tools
	20.	How can AI tools and techniques be integrated into the workshop delivery itself (e.g., generating insights in real-time)? Unsure, feel free to provide thoughts."
